# Assignment 4 â€“ Working with Processes

## 1. Viewing Processes
- Used `ps aux` to view all running processes.
- Used `top` to monitor live process activity.
- Filtered by user: `ps -u ubuntu`
- Filtered by PID: `ps -p [PID]`
- Filtered by command: `ps aux | grep [command]`

## 2. Managing Processes
- Ran `sleep 60` in terminal.
- Found PID with `ps aux | grep sleep`
- Terminated process using `kill [PID]`
- Used `killall sleep` and `pkill sleep` for name-based termination.

## 3. Background and Foreground Execution
- Ran: `sleep 120 &` (background)
- Checked background jobs with: `jobs`
- Brought job to foreground with: `fg`
- Paused a foreground job with `Ctrl + Z` and resumed in background with `bg`

Summary: Practiced process inspection, termination, and job control using built-in Linux tools.
