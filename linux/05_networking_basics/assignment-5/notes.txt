# Assignment 5 â€“ Networking Basics

## 1. Checking Network Connectivity
- Verified reachability with: `ping google.com`
- Traced packet route using: `traceroute google.com`

## 2. Viewing Network Configuration
- Viewed interface info using: `ip addr`
- Fallback command (if available): `ifconfig`
- Viewed routing table: `ip route`

## 3. Checking Open Ports and Connections
- Checked listening ports and connections:
  - `netstat -tulnp` (if installed)
  - `ss -tulnp` (modern alternative)
- Filtered processes by port:
  - `ss -ltnp | grep :80`
  - `netstat -tulnp | grep :22`

Summary: Practiced connectivity testing, interface and route inspection, and socket monitoring. Learned to diagnose basic network issues from CLI.
