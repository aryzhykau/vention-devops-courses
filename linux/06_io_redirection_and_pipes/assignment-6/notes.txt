# Assignment 6 â€“ I/O Redirection and Pipes

## 1. Standard Output Redirection
- Redirected output: `ls -l > files_list.txt`
- Appended output: `date >> files_list.txt`
- Redirected both stdout and stderr:
  - `command &> output_and_error.log`
  - OR: `command > out.txt 2>&1`

## 2. Standard Input Redirection
- Sorted file input: `sort < unsorted.txt > sorted.txt`

## 3. Using Pipes
- Filtered and processed:
  - `cat file.txt | grep "pattern" | sort | uniq`
- Counted lines with pattern: `cat file.txt | grep "pattern" | wc -l`
- Combined redirection and piping:
  - `cat file.txt | grep "error" > errors_only.txt`

Summary: Practiced redirecting output/input, capturing errors, chaining commands, and building pipelines to streamline shell workflows.
