# Task 5: Advanced Networking

## Overview
This task focuses on implementing advanced networking features in AWS VPC. You will learn how to configure IPv6 support, set up egress-only internet gateways, implement VPC sharing, configure AWS PrivateLink, and manage DNS resolution.

## Objectives
1. Implement IPv6 support
2. Set up egress-only IGW
3. Configure VPC sharing
4. Implement PrivateLink
5. Set up DNS resolution

## Prerequisites
- AWS account with VPC access
- Existing VPC with subnets
- AWS CLI configured
- Terraform installed
- Basic understanding of advanced networking concepts

## Implementation Steps

### 1. IPv6 Support
- Enable IPv6 for VPC
- Configure subnet addressing
- Set up routing tables
- Configure security groups
- Implement dual-stack instances

### 2. Egress-Only Internet Gateway
- Create egress-only IGW
- Configure route tables
- Set up security rules
- Implement outbound access
- Configure monitoring

### 3. VPC Sharing
- Enable resource sharing
- Configure RAM settings
- Share subnets
- Set up permissions
- Implement monitoring

### 4. PrivateLink
- Create VPC endpoint service
- Configure service consumers
- Set up endpoint policies
- Implement security controls
- Configure logging

### 5. DNS Resolution
- Configure private DNS
- Set up Route 53 resolver
- Implement conditional forwarding
- Configure hybrid DNS
- Set up monitoring

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] IPv6 working correctly
- [ ] Egress-only IGW operational
- [ ] VPC sharing configured
- [ ] PrivateLink functioning
- [ ] DNS resolution working

## Security Considerations
- Implement proper routing
- Configure security groups
- Enable encryption
- Monitor traffic
- Regular audits
