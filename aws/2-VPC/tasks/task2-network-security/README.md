# Task 2: Network Security

## Overview
This task focuses on implementing comprehensive network security controls in AWS VPC. You will learn how to configure Network ACLs, Security Groups, VPC Flow Logs, and implement traffic monitoring and filtering.

## Objectives
1. Configure Network ACLs
2. Set up Security Groups
3. Implement VPC Flow Logs
4. Configure traffic mirroring
5. Set up network firewall

## Prerequisites
- AWS account with VPC access
- Existing VPC with subnets
- AWS CLI configured
- Terraform installed
- Basic understanding of network security concepts

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Network ACLs Configuration
- Create custom Network ACLs
- Configure inbound rules
- Set up outbound rules
- Associate with subnets
- Implement stateless filtering

### 2. Security Groups Setup
- Create application security groups
- Configure inbound rules
- Set up outbound rules
- Implement service-based rules
- Configure cross-reference rules

### 3. VPC Flow Logs
- Enable VPC Flow Logs
- Configure log destination
- Set up log format
- Implement log analysis
- Configure alerts

### 4. Traffic Mirroring
- Set up traffic mirror targets
- Configure mirror filters
- Set up mirror sessions
- Implement packet capture
- Configure monitoring

### 5. Network Firewall
- Deploy AWS Network Firewall
- Configure firewall rules
- Set up domain filtering
- Implement IPS/IDS
- Configure logging

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] Network ACLs properly configured
- [ ] Security Groups working correctly
- [ ] Flow logs capturing traffic
- [ ] Traffic mirroring operational
- [ ] Network firewall enforcing rules

## Security Considerations
- Follow least privilege principle
- Implement proper logging
- Regular security audits
- Monitor traffic patterns
- Update rules as needed
