# AWS Disaster Recovery

## Overview
Disaster Recovery (DR) in AWS involves a set of policies, tools, and procedures to enable the recovery of infrastructure and data following a disaster. AWS provides multiple strategies and services to implement robust DR solutions.

## Disaster Recovery Strategies

### 1. Backup and Restore
- **Characteristics**
  - Lowest cost
  - Minimal infrastructure
  - Higher RPO/RTO
  - Offline recovery

- **Implementation**
  - Regular backups
  - Cross-region copies
  - Restoration testing
  - Documentation

### 2. Pilot Light
- **Characteristics**
  - Core services running
  - Minimal costs
  - Medium RPO/RTO
  - Quick activation

- **Implementation**
  - Critical DB replication
  - DNS configuration
  - Basic infrastructure
  - Scale-up capability

### 3. Warm Standby
- **Characteristics**
  - Scaled-down version
  - Business continuity
  - Lower RPO/RTO
  - Always running

- **Implementation**
  - Active-passive setup
  - Load balancer config
  - Data replication
  - Auto scaling ready

## Key Concepts

### 1. Recovery Metrics
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**
  - Data loss tolerance
  - Backup frequency
  - Replication lag
  - Business impact

- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**
  - Downtime tolerance
  - Recovery speed
  - Resource availability
  - Cost implications

### 2. Availability Zones and Regions
- **AZ Redundancy**
  - Infrastructure isolation
  - Power independence
  - Network connectivity
  - Service availability

- **Regional Failover**
  - Geographic separation
  - Data sovereignty
  - Latency considerations
  - Cost variations
