# Task 3: Disaster Recovery Testing and Documentation

## Overview
This task focuses on implementing disaster recovery testing procedures and creating comprehensive documentation. You will learn how to validate backup restoration, test failover procedures, and document recovery processes.

## Objectives
1. Create automated DR test procedures
2. Implement backup validation checks
3. Set up recovery validation testing
4. Create incident response documentation
5. Implement monitoring for DR components

## AWS Free Tier Considerations
- Lambda: 1 million free requests per month
- CloudWatch: Basic monitoring metrics
- S3: 5GB storage for documentation
- SNS: 1 million notifications
- EventBridge: Free tier available for scheduling

## Implementation Steps

### 1. DR Test Automation
- Create Lambda functions for testing
- Set up test schedules
- Implement validation checks
- Configure test reporting

### 2. Backup Validation
- Automate backup testing
- Verify backup integrity
- Test restoration procedures
- Document validation results

### 3. Recovery Testing
- Create recovery test plans
- Implement automated recovery tests
- Validate recovery points
- Test failover procedures

### 4. Documentation Management
- Create runbooks
- Document recovery procedures
- Maintain incident response plans
- Update testing results

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] Automated tests running successfully
- [ ] Backup validation passing
- [ ] Recovery procedures documented
- [ ] Test results properly logged
- [ ] Documentation up to date
