# Task 1: Backup and Recovery Fundamentals

## Overview
This task focuses on implementing fundamental backup and recovery mechanisms using AWS Free Tier compatible services. You will learn how to set up automated backups, configure retention policies, and implement basic disaster recovery procedures.

## Objectives
1. Configure AWS Backup for EBS volumes and RDS instances
2. Implement S3 lifecycle policies for cost-effective backup storage
3. Set up cross-region backup replication
4. Configure backup monitoring and reporting
5. Define and implement RPO/RTO strategies

## AWS Free Tier Considerations
- AWS Backup: Free Tier includes 10GB of backup storage
- S3: 5GB storage with standard access tier
- CloudWatch: Basic monitoring metrics
- SNS: First 1 million notifications free

## Implementation Steps

### 1. AWS Backup Configuration
- Create backup vault
- Define backup plans for EBS volumes
- Configure backup rules for RDS instances
- Set up retention policies

### 2. S3 Backup Storage
- Create S3 buckets for backup storage
- Implement lifecycle policies
- Configure versioning
- Set up cross-region replication

### 3. Monitoring Setup
- Configure CloudWatch metrics
- Set up backup success/failure alerts
- Create backup status dashboard
- Implement notification system

### 4. Recovery Testing
- Document recovery procedures
- Test backup restoration
- Validate backup integrity
- Measure recovery times

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] Successful automated backups
- [ ] Proper retention policy implementation
- [ ] Working monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Successful recovery testing
- [ ] Documentation completion
