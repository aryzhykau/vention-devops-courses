# Task 2: Application Migration

## Overview
This task focuses on implementing application migration using AWS Server Migration Service (SMS) and related services while staying within AWS Free Tier limits. You will learn how to migrate applications, configure load balancing, and set up auto-scaling.

## Objectives
1. Set up AWS Server Migration Service
2. Configure EC2 instance migration
3. Implement load balancing
4. Set up Auto Scaling
5. Monitor migration progress

## AWS Free Tier Considerations
- EC2: t2.micro instances (750 hours)
- ELB: 750 hours of load balancer usage
- CloudWatch: Basic monitoring
- Auto Scaling: No additional charge
- VPC: No additional charge

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Migration Setup
- Configure SMS service
- Set up IAM roles
- Create migration templates
- Configure replication settings

### 2. Application Infrastructure
- Create VPC and subnets
- Configure security groups
- Set up load balancer
- Create Auto Scaling group

### 3. Migration Process
- Create application migration
- Configure instance specifications
- Set up incremental replication
- Schedule cutover

### 4. Monitoring and Validation
- Configure CloudWatch metrics
- Set up migration alerts
- Monitor application health
- Validate migration success

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] SMS configured correctly
- [ ] Application migrated successfully
- [ ] Load balancer functioning
- [ ] Auto Scaling working
- [ ] Monitoring active
