# Task 3: Storage Migration

## Overview
This task focuses on implementing storage migration using AWS storage services while staying within AWS Free Tier limits. You will learn how to migrate data between different storage solutions and implement backup strategies.

## Objectives
1. Set up S3 data migration
2. Configure EBS volume migration
3. Implement Storage Gateway
4. Set up backup policies
5. Monitor migration progress

## AWS Free Tier Considerations
- S3: 5GB storage
- EBS: 30GB of General Purpose (gp2) storage
- Storage Gateway: 100GB of data transfer
- Backup: 10GB of backup storage
- CloudWatch: Basic monitoring

## Implementation Steps

### 1. S3 Migration Setup
- Create source and destination buckets
- Configure bucket policies
- Set up replication rules
- Enable versioning

### 2. Volume Migration
- Create EBS volumes
- Configure snapshots
- Set up volume copying
- Implement backup policies

### 3. Storage Gateway
- Configure Storage Gateway
- Set up file shares
- Configure cache settings
- Implement backup schedule

### 4. Monitoring and Validation
- Set up CloudWatch metrics
- Configure storage alerts
- Monitor transfer progress
- Validate data integrity

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] S3 replication working
- [ ] Volume migration successful
- [ ] Storage Gateway configured
- [ ] Backups running
- [ ] Monitoring active
