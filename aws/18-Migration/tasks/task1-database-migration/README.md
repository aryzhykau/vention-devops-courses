# Task 1: Database Migration

## Overview
This task focuses on implementing database migration using AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) while staying within AWS Free Tier limits. You will learn how to set up and configure database migration, perform schema conversion, and implement continuous data replication.

## Objectives
1. Set up AWS DMS replication instance
2. Configure source and target endpoints
3. Create and manage migration tasks
4. Implement schema conversion
5. Monitor migration progress

## AWS Free Tier Considerations
- DMS: 750 hours of t2.micro replication instance
- S3: 5GB storage for schema files
- RDS: 750 hours of t2.micro database instance
- CloudWatch: Basic monitoring metrics

## Implementation Steps

### 1. DMS Setup
- Create replication subnet group
- Launch t2.micro replication instance
- Configure security groups
- Set up IAM roles

### 2. Database Endpoints
- Configure source database endpoint
- Set up target database endpoint
- Test endpoint connectivity
- Validate database access

### 3. Migration Task
- Create migration task
- Configure table mappings
- Set up transformation rules
- Enable CloudWatch logging

### 4. Monitoring and Validation
- Set up CloudWatch metrics
- Configure migration alerts
- Validate data consistency
- Monitor replication status

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] Replication instance running
- [ ] Endpoints connected successfully
- [ ] Migration task executing
- [ ] Data validation complete
- [ ] Monitoring configured
