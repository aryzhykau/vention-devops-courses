## Prerequisites
- AWS account with administrative access
- Terraform installed (version 1.0.0 or later)
- AWS CLI configured
- Basic understanding of cloud computing concepts
- Familiarity with Linux/Unix commands

## Learning Objectives
1. Understand EC2 core concepts and features
2. Deploy and manage EC2 instances using Terraform
3. Implement high availability and scalability
4. Configure security and monitoring
5. Apply best practices for production environments

## Practical Tasks

### Task 1: Basic Instance Management

- Manage instance lifecycle
- Work with different instance types
- Configure storage and networking
- Implement basic security

### Task 2: Load Balancing and Auto Scaling
- Set up Application Load Balancer
- Configure Auto Scaling Groups
- Implement scaling policies
- Monitor scaling events
- Manage target groups

### Task 3: High Availability Setup
- Deploy across multiple AZs
- Implement failover mechanisms
- Configure disaster recovery
- Set up backup strategies
- Monitor system health

### Task 4: Security Implementation
- Configure IAM roles and policies
- Implement security groups and NACLs
- Set up encryption and key management
- Configure security monitoring
- Implement compliance controls

### Task 5: Monitoring and Optimization
- Set up CloudWatch monitoring
- Configure custom metrics
- Create monitoring dashboards
- Implement cost optimization
- Configure performance optimization

## Documentation

### Concepts
Detailed documentation about EC2 concepts is available in [docs/concepts.md](docs/concepts.md), covering:
- Instance types and families
- Amazon Machine Images (AMI)
- Storage options
- Networking features
- Auto Scaling and load balancing
- Pricing models
- Advanced features

### Best Practices
Comprehensive best practices are documented in [docs/best-practices.md](docs/best-practices.md), including:
- Security best practices
- Performance optimization
- High availability design
- Cost optimization
- Monitoring and management
- Operational excellence
- Compliance and auditing

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd aws/05-EC2
```

2. Navigate to a specific task:
```bash
cd tasks/task1-basic-instance
```

3. Initialize Terraform:
```bash
terraform init
```

4. Review the execution plan:
```bash
terraform plan
```

5. Apply the configuration:
```bash
terraform apply
```

6. Clean up resources:
```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Validation

Each task includes validation steps to ensure proper implementation:

1. Basic Instance Management:
```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances \
  --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=basic-instance"
```

2. Load Balancing:
```bash
aws elbv2 describe-target-health \
  --target-group-arn <target-group-arn>
```

3. High Availability:
```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances \
  --filters "Name=tag:aws:autoscaling:groupName,Values=ha-asg"
```

4. Security:
```bash
aws ec2 describe-security-groups
aws iam list-roles
```

5. Monitoring:
```bash
aws cloudwatch list-metrics \
  --namespace AWS/EC2
```
