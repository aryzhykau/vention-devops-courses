# AWS DynamoDB Module

This module covers working with Amazon DynamoDB, a fully managed NoSQL database service. Through a series of tasks, you'll learn how to design, create, and manage DynamoDB tables, implement different data models, and use various DynamoDB features.

## Task Structure

1. **Task 1: Basic DynamoDB Operations**
   - Table creation and management
   - CRUD operations
   - Capacity management (provisioned vs on-demand)
   - Basic data modeling
   - Working with items and attributes
   - Using DynamoDB SDK

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- AWS CLI configured
- Basic understanding of NoSQL databases
- Completed Lambda module (recommended)
