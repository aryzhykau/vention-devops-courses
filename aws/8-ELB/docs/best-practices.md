# Amazon Elastic Load Balancer Best Practices

## Architecture and Design

### Load Balancer Selection
1. Choose the Right Type
   - Use ALB for HTTP/HTTPS applications
   - Use NLB for TCP/UDP/TLS applications
   - Use GWLB for network security appliances

2. Availability Zone Coverage
   - Enable multiple AZs for high availability
   - Use at least two AZs
   - Balance targets across AZs

3. Subnet Selection
   - Use public subnets for internet-facing load balancers
   - Use private subnets for internal load balancers
   - Ensure sufficient IP addresses in subnets

### Target Group Design
1. Target Distribution
   - Distribute targets evenly across AZs
   - Use appropriate target type (instance, IP, Lambda)
   - Consider target group limits

2. Health Check Configuration
   - Use application-specific health checks
   - Set appropriate thresholds and intervals
   - Implement custom health check logic

## Security

### Network Security
1. Security Groups
   - Restrict inbound traffic to necessary ports
   - Allow health check traffic
   - Use separate security groups for load balancers and targets

2. Network ACLs
   - Configure stateless rules carefully
   - Allow health check ports
   - Consider ephemeral ports

### SSL/TLS
1. Certificate Management
   - Use ACM for certificate management
   - Implement automatic renewal
   - Use strong security policies

2. Security Policies
   - Disable older TLS versions
   - Use recommended cipher suites
   - Enable Perfect Forward Secrecy

### Authentication
1. Application Authentication
   - Use OIDC or Cognito where possible
   - Implement session management
   - Consider token validation

2. Access Control
   - Implement WAF rules
   - Use geographic restrictions
   - Enable Shield protection

## Performance

### Scaling and Capacity
1. Auto Scaling
   - Use target tracking scaling policies
   - Set appropriate scaling thresholds
   - Monitor scaling events

2. Load Balancer Capacity
   - Pre-warm for expected traffic spikes
   - Monitor capacity metrics
   - Use appropriate load balancer type

### Optimization
1. Connection Settings
   - Configure appropriate idle timeout
   - Use connection draining
   - Enable keep-alive

2. Routing Optimization
   - Use path-based routing efficiently
   - Implement caching where possible
   - Optimize rule evaluation order

## Monitoring and Operations

### Metrics and Logging
1. CloudWatch Integration
   - Monitor key metrics
   - Set up appropriate alarms
   - Use detailed monitoring

2. Access Logging
   - Enable access logs
   - Use appropriate log retention
   - Implement log analysis

### Operational Excellence
1. Documentation
   - Document configuration changes
   - Maintain runbooks
   - Keep architecture diagrams updated

2. Testing
   - Perform regular failover tests
   - Test scaling capabilities
   - Validate health checks

## Cost Optimization

### Resource Utilization
1. Right-sizing
   - Choose appropriate load balancer type
   - Monitor usage patterns
   - Adjust capacity as needed

2. Cross-Zone Load Balancing
   - Understand data transfer costs
   - Enable when needed
   - Monitor cost impact

### Cost Monitoring
1. Cost Allocation
   - Use appropriate tags
   - Monitor per-application costs
   - Track data transfer costs

2. Optimization Strategies
   - Remove unused resources
   - Consolidate load balancers where possible
   - Use reserved capacity when appropriate

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup and Recovery
1. Multi-Region Strategy
   - Implement regional failover
   - Use Route 53 health checks
   - Maintain configuration backups

2. Failover Testing
   - Regular DR drills
   - Document recovery procedures
   - Test failback procedures

### High Availability
1. Architecture
   - Use multiple AZs
   - Implement redundant targets
   - Configure appropriate health checks

2. Monitoring
   - Monitor failover events
   - Track recovery time
   - Analyze failure patterns

## Integration Best Practices

### Auto Scaling Groups
1. Configuration
   - Use appropriate launch templates
   - Set correct health check grace periods
   - Configure instance protection

2. Scaling Policies
   - Use target tracking when possible
   - Set appropriate cooldown periods
   - Monitor scaling activities

### Route 53
1. DNS Configuration
   - Use alias records
   - Configure appropriate TTLs
   - Implement health checks

2. Failover Configuration
   - Set up DNS failover
   - Use appropriate routing policies
   - Monitor DNS resolution

### WAF and Shield
1. Protection Rules
   - Implement appropriate rule sets
   - Monitor rule effectiveness
   - Update rules regularly

2. DDoS Protection
   - Enable Shield Advanced when needed
   - Monitor attack patterns
   - Maintain incident response plans

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Maintenance
1. Updates
   - Keep security policies current
   - Update certificates before expiry
   - Patch targets regularly

2. Configuration Review
   - Audit security settings
   - Review performance metrics
   - Update documentation

### Troubleshooting
1. Common Issues
   - Document known issues
   - Maintain troubleshooting guides
   - Track resolution times

2. Support
   - Maintain AWS Support contact
   - Document escalation procedures
   - Keep contact information current
