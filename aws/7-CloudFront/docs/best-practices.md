# Amazon CloudFront Best Practices

## Performance Optimization

### Cache Hit Ratio
1. Optimize Cache Keys
   - Include only necessary query parameters
   - Normalize URL parameters
   - Consider case sensitivity

2. TTL Settings
   - Set appropriate TTL values based on content type
   - Use cache-control headers from origin
   - Implement versioning for static assets

3. Origin Shield
   - Enable in the region closest to your origin
   - Use for global distributions
   - Monitor cost vs. performance benefits

### Content Delivery
1. Compression
   - Enable compression for text-based content
   - Set appropriate minimum file size
   - Use supported file types

2. Origin Response

3. Custom Headers
   - Implement security headers
   - Configure CORS properly
   - Use custom origin headers

## Cost Optimization

### Traffic Management
1. Price Class Selection
   - Choose based on audience location
   - Balance cost vs. performance
   - Regular review of usage patterns

2. Request Optimization
   - Minimize origin requests
   - Implement proper caching
   - Monitor invalidation requests

3. Data Transfer
   - Use compression when possible
   - Optimize file sizes
   - Monitor transfer patterns

### Feature Usage
1. Optional Features
   - Enable only necessary features
