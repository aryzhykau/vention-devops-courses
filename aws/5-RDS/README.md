## Prerequisites
- AWS account with administrative access
- Terraform installed (version 1.0.0 or later)
- AWS CLI configured
- Basic understanding of relational databases
- Familiarity with SQL

## Learning Objectives
1. Understand RDS core concepts and features
2. Deploy and manage RDS instances using Terraform
3. Implement high availability and disaster recovery
4. Configure security and monitoring
5. Apply performance optimization techniques

## Practical Tasks

### Task 1: Basic RDS Setup
- Create and configure RDS instances
- Set up different database engines
- Configure storage and networking
- Implement basic security
- Manage database parameters

### Task 2: High Availability Setup
- Configure Multi-AZ deployment
- Set up Read Replicas
- Implement automatic failover
- Configure backup strategies
- Test disaster recovery

### Task 3: Security Implementation
- Configure VPC and security groups
- Implement encryption at rest
- Set up SSL/TLS connections
- Manage IAM authentication
- Configure audit logging

## Documentation

### Concepts
Detailed documentation about RDS concepts is available in [docs/concepts.md](docs/concepts.md), covering:
- Database engines
- Instance types
- Storage options
- High availability features
- Backup and recovery
- Security features
- Monitoring capabilities

### Best Practices
Comprehensive best practices are documented in [docs/best-practices.md](docs/best-practices.md), including:
- Security best practices
- Performance optimization
- High availability design
- Cost optimization
- Monitoring and maintenance
- Operational excellence
- Compliance and auditing

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd aws/05-RDS
```

2. Navigate to a specific task:
```bash
cd tasks/task1-basic-setup
```

3. Initialize Terraform:
```bash
terraform init
```

4. Review the execution plan:
```bash
terraform plan
```

5. Apply the configuration:
```bash
terraform apply
```

6. Clean up resources:
```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Validation

Each task includes validation steps to ensure proper implementation:

1. Basic Setup:
```bash
aws rds describe-db-instances \
  --db-instance-identifier your-db-instance
```

2. High Availability:
```bash
aws rds describe-db-clusters \
  --db-cluster-identifier your-db-cluster
```

3. Security:
```bash
aws rds describe-db-security-groups
aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[*].StorageEncrypted'
```
```
