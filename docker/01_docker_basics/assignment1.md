## Task 3: Working with Containers

```bash
# Run nginx container in detached mode
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name my-nginx nginx

# Check running containers
docker ps

# View logs
docker logs my-nginx

# Stop the container
docker stop my-nginx

# Start the container again
docker start my-nginx

# Delete the container
docker rm -f my-nginx
```

**Explanation:**  
This task involved managing the lifecycle of an `nginx` container. After starting it, we verified it was running, checked the logs, stopped and restarted it, and finally removed it using the `rm -f` flag which forces deletion even if the container is running.

## Task 4: Exploring Images

```bash
# View list of local images
docker images

# Inspect the nginx image
docker inspect nginx
```

**Findings:**
- **Image size:** ~183.5 MB
- **Architecture:** amd64
- **Layers:**  
  The nginx image has 7 layers. Docker uses these to cache and optimize builds. Each layer represents changes made to the base image.  
  Examples:
  - sha256:ace34d1d...
  - sha256:deb7d887...
  - sha256:cb857378...

**Explanation:**  
Inspecting images helps us understand how Docker stores and builds containers. Layers are key to Dockerâ€™s efficiency. Knowing the image size, architecture, and layer structure is useful when debugging, optimizing, or auditing images.
